<p><em>Code and data can be found on <a href="https://github.com/mathieubray/SNL">Github</a></em></p>
<p>Figured I should chime in here since it’s been… let’s see here… ah, 4 months. I had previously <a href="https://twitter.com/mathieubray/status/840665088046567424">promised</a> to write about some <a href="https://github.com/mathieubray/Hockey">NCAA hockey projects</a> I had been working on. That… will have to wait -_-. In the meantime, let’s look instead at some Saturday Night Live data!</p>
<p>For those not familiar, <a href="https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live">Saturday Night Live</a>, commonly abbreviated as ‘SNL’, is a comedy-variety show that airs live on <a href="https://www.nbc.com/">NBC</a> on select Saturday nights over the course of a ‘season’, which runs from September through May. SNL first aired in 1975, and is currently airing its 43rd season. Each episode features a celebrity guest host who participates in most of the sketches, along with a musical guest who performs twice over the course of the show.</p>
<p>A simple question came to me after watching a disappointing episode of SNL hosted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumail_Nanjiani">Kumail Nanjiani</a> a few weeks ago. This episode just happened to be the third in a sequence of episodes airing over consecutive weeks. Knowing the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/saturday-night-live-how-an-episode-is-put-together-2015-7">grueling schedule</a> that SNL writers operate on, I was curious if, as in <a href="https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2013/4/8/4188626/philadelphia-flyers-goaltending-stats-back-to-back-games">sports such as hockey</a>, some kind of fatigue, in this case something akin to writer’s block, may impact the quality of an episode.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll perform exploratory analysis on SNL episode quality to get an idea of whether or not my ‘writer’s fatigue’ hypothesis makes sense. Episode quality will be based on averaged ratings (on a 0-10 scale) of users on <a href="https://www.imdb.com">IMDb</a>, inspired by previous analyses of TV shows such as <a href="http://www.nathancunn.com/2017-10-26-simpsons-decline/">‘The Simpsons’</a>. I’ll note that, while writing this post, I thought the most recent episode hosted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chance_the_Rapper">Chance the Rapper</a> was fantastic, and also happened to be the third episode in a stretch of three consecutive weeks of episodes.</p>
<p>I’ll also make clear right at the onset that this post is meant mostly as a fun exercise. There are a number of caveats to using IMDb data, such as the variable number of votes given to each episode, the composition of users that determine the ratings, and the rounding of final ratings to 1 decimal place. SNL ratings in particular are likely highly driven by topical events that occurred around the time of each episode, as well as the quality/notoriety/likability of the host. While a more determined analyst would do well to adjust for these factors, a much more involved cleaning job on the data will likely be required (something for the future perhaps?).</p>
<p>All that being said, let’s get right into it, starting by loading our handy libraries.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)     # Lifeblood of data science
library(rvest)     # Scrape scrape scrape
library(purrr)     # &#39;map&#39; function

<h3>Scrape, Scrape, Scrape!</h3>
<p>For those not interested in the data collection portion of this post, but who still want to play along at home, full data can be found <a href="https://github.com/mathieubray/SNL/tree/master/Data">here</a>, and feel free to <a href="#snl-ratings-distributions">skip</a> directly to the analysis section.</p>
<p>As is usually the case for any project, the required data will have to be collected in pieces from disparate sources, cleaned separately and merged into a tidy format. First we need the ratings of each episode, which we scrape from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072562/epdate">IMDb</a> using the <code>read_html</code>, <code>html_nodes</code>, and <code>html_table</code> functions from the <code>rvest</code> package. The main table of interest is the first table collected under the <code>'table'</code> tag, which we convert to an R data frame.</p>

<p>I prefer scraping tables specifying <code>header=F</code>, as the headers of tables on websites tend to be in odd formats that screw up the scraping process (plus I usually end up changing variable names anyway). We remove the first row in our scraped table (which contains the headers we see on the web), then remove the last column of gibberish, and assign our own variable names. From there, we extract the season number from the first column of data, which is the number that appears before the <code>.</code> in that field. Finally, we filter out episodes from the current season (the 43rd season).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Helper function for extracting the season from the full episode number

<p>So we have our ratings, but if we are to look at how breaks and consecutive runs of episodes affect ratings, we also need the date each episode aired (the ‘airdate’), which is not found in the data we collected. Various sources contain airdate information, including <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072562/episodes">IMDb</a>, though not in a handy table format, meaning a scraper would be quite a bit more tedious to design. Luckily, the airdates happen to be conveniently laid out on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Saturday_Night_Live_episodes">Wikipedia</a>, and so we’ll simply go with that.</p>
<p>Tables of airdates, one for each season, are spread across three sections. We collect all tables across all three sections and bind these together. Note that tables in the last section contain some TV ratings information from Nielsen (these estimate number of viewers, not necessarily episode quality), which we omit when combining.</p>

<p>Other than removing the website headers collected within the table (conveniently the string ‘Original air date’ appears in each case in the fifth column) and renaming our variables, we extract the airdate from the final column and convert to a more R-friendly format using <code>lubridate</code>.</p>

<p>Notice this data set does not contain the season number, but since we have the episode number within each season, we can extract the first episode of each season and assign its season number, then create a new variable in the original data set with the season number for these episodes and ’NA’s for the rest. We then use the <code>locf</code> function from the <code>zoo</code> package to carry the last observation forward, filling out the season number for the remaning episodes.</p>

<p>It seems the number of episodes in each seasons don’t line up exactly; there are extra episodes in the ratings dataset for Seasons 2 and 10.</p>
<p>Typically, in a larger data setting, one would employ some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_matching_(computer-assisted_translation)">fuzzy matching</a> scheme to match the <code>Host</code> field from the airdate dataset and the <code>Guest</code> field from the ratings dataset (especially since we can’t generally guarantee that the correct order of data points has been preserved). Since the data here is not particularly large, and there appears to only be two errors, we will inspect the situation manually.</p>

<p>The extra season 10 episode in the ratings dataset is ‘SNL Film Festival’. Note that while the host of the season premiere is listed as ‘(none)’ in the airdate dataset, the musical guest (‘Thompson Twins’) matches the <code>Guest</code> field from the ratings dataset (in some SNL episodes, the host doubles as the musical guest).</p>
<p>We filter out these two extra episodes, and then bind the two datasets together.</p>

<h3>SNL Ratings Distributions</h3>
<p>Alright, we have our data, now let’s make some charts! First let’s take a quick look at ratings curves by season. We use the excellent <code>ggridges</code> package, by <a href="https://twitter.com/ClausWilke">Claus O. Wilke</a> (available from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html">CRAN</a>), to display the large number of density curves (note that you may have heard of this package by <a href="http://serialmentor.com/blog/2017/9/15/goodbye-joyplots">another name</a>). I also use the <code>viridis</code> package to display the median episode rating for each season by a user-friendly color.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Extract median episode rating for each season
median.ratings &lt;- snl.data %&gt;% 
  group_by(Season) %&gt;% 
  summarize(MedianRating = median(Rating))

# Merge medians to SNL data

  left_join(median.ratings, by=&quot;Season&quot;)

# Plot rating densities
ggplot(data=snl.data, aes(x=Rating, y=as.factor(Season), fill=MedianRating)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha=0.7, rel_min_height=0.01) +
  scale_fill_viridis(name = &quot;Median Rating&quot;) +
  scale_y_discrete(position=&quot;right&quot;) +
  theme_bw(16) +
  xlim(0,10) +
  xlab(&quot;Rating&quot;) +
  ylab(&quot;Season&quot;) +
  annotate(&quot;text&quot;,x=5,y=20,col=&quot;red&quot;,label=&quot;@mathieubray 2017&quot;,
           alpha=0.15,cex=15,fontface=&quot;bold&quot;,angle=30) +
  ggtitle(&quot;SNL Ratings Density by Season&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Color represents median episode rating from the given season. Data from imdb.com&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/SNL-Charts_files/figure-html/snl_1-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>This chart gives a nice snapshot of viewer’s impressions of SNL over the years, with strong early seasons followed by a comparatively mediocre stretch from Seasons 9-16 (corresponding to 1983-1990), and another slightly worse stretch around Season 22 to Season 30 (1996-2004). While recent seasons appear to be more favorably rated in general, there does not seem to be much evidence to suggest any major SNL renaissance (which one would assume if we look at the number of <a href="http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/saturday-night-live-emmy-wins-kate-mckinnon-alec-baldwin-1202557463/">Emmys</a> earned last season).</p>
<p>Check out that rough patch in Season 41 where the density perks up far to the left of the main ratings curve. Tough to tell what may have caused that…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>snl.data %&gt;% 
  filter(Season==41, Rating &lt; 4.0) %&gt;%
  select(Season, SeasonEpNumber, Host, AirDate, Rating, Votes)# One of the least popular episodes</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   Season SeasonEpNumber         Host    AirDate Rating Votes
## 1     41              4 Donald Trump 2015-11-07    3.7   492</code></pre>
<p>I’ll reiterate here that the IMDb ratings are reported as the average of ratings on a 0-10 scale. I should note that the number of votes tend to be high for recent episodes as well as early episodes, while episodes from most of the other seasons have comparatively much fewer votes.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mean.votes &lt;- snl.data %&gt;% 
  group_by(Season) %&gt;% 
  summarize(MeanVotes = mean(Votes))

snl.data &lt;- snl.data %&gt;%
  left_join(mean.votes, by=&quot;Season&quot;)

<p><img src="/post/SNL-Charts_files/figure-html/snl_2-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>The overall distribution of ratings is shown below, as both a histogram (recall that ratings are collected rounded to 1 decimal place, effectively discretizing the data), as well as a density curve.</p>

<p>We observe a bimodal density curve with most episodes earning ratings around 6.0 (‘mediocre’ episodes), or around 7.5 (‘good-great’ episodes). We continue to use densities going forward, mostly based on their elegance and ease of qualitative interpretation.</p>

<h3>SNL Ratings Based on Number of Weeks Between Episodes</h3>
<p>We are interested in observing whether some kind of ‘writer fatigue’ may affect the quality of SNL episodes. First, we will calculate for each episode the number of weeks since the previous episode, a.k.a. the break betwen each episode. This can be achieved using the <code>lag</code> function (to collect in a separate variable the airdate of the episode previous to each episode), and the <code>as.period</code> function from the <code>lubridate</code> package, to extract the difference in days between two airdates, which we then convert to a number of weeks. A snippet of the data with the new column is shown below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>### Ratings based on number of weeks since last episode

# Add in the number of weeks since the last episode
snl.data.enhanced &lt;- snl.data %&gt;%
  mutate(PreviousAirDate = lag(AirDate), # Get airdate of previous episode
         WeeksSinceLastEpisode = as.period(AirDate - PreviousAirDate)@day / 7) %&gt;% # Calculate number of weeks since last episode

<p>(The <code>NA</code> above is due to the first episode not having a previous episode from which to calculate the number of weeks since the last episode). We discretize our variable, using the <code>case_when</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package (which I first learned from <a href="http://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2017-02-17-lesser_known_tricks/">here</a>, along with some other neat <code>dplyr</code> tricks), designating any break longer than 4 weeks as <code>4+</code> to balance the categories.</p>

<p>Some takeaways from this set of charts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ‘good-great’ mode is lower for episodes with no break (equivalently, 1 week since last episode)</li>
<li>Episodes with a week break prior (equivalently, 2 weeks since last episode) see a more even distribution of episode ratings</li>
<li>For episodes with long breaks prior to air, the distribution skews much higher toward ‘good-great’</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems to lend evidence to support the fatigue hypothesis, though there are a few other factors we should probably keep in mind. Let’s look at episodes written with at least a week break versus those without.</p>

<p>The ‘No Break’ curve is equivalent to the top-left graph from the previous chart. We once again observe a bimodal distribution for episodes that aired with a break, though with fewer ‘medicore’ episodes and more ‘good-great’ episodes. It is interesting that we also observe a small third cluster of very poorly rated episodes among episodes that aired with a break.</p>
<p>Most of the episodes with at least 4 weeks of break are season premieres, ostensibly with a full summer of ideas fresh in the writers’ minds. Let’s look at the distribution of ratings for season premieres versus non-season premieres.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>snl.data.enhanced &lt;- snl.data.enhanced %&gt;%

<h3>SNL Ratings Based on Consecutive Episode Sequences</h3>
<p>Similar the length of the break prior to each episode, we can also look at the sequence of consecutive episodes and how that affects episode ratings. Episodes that air at the end of a sequence of consecutive episodes may well suffer in quality compared to those at the beginning of the sequence (i.e. those that aired after at least a week break).</p>
<p>The code to determine the placement of each episode within a sequence of consecutive episodes is included below. I used a ‘for’ loop here (gasp!), since I couldn’t quite figure out how to do this effectively in a more R-friendly way. If anyone has any suggestions, shoot me a line in the comments or on the <a href="https://twitter.com/mathieubray">Twitters</a>.</p>

<p>The leftmost panel is equivalent to the ‘Break’ curve shown previously. Episodes that aired as the second in a sequence of episodes (middle panel) see slightly more ‘mediocre’ episodes and slightly fewer ‘good-great’ episodes. The rightmost panel, which include episodes airing at the end of a long sequence of episodes, appears to be more spread out, with dips in both of the main modes. While interesting, there may be more at play here. For example, it may make a difference if, for example, the episode is the second in a long sequence of consecutive episodes versus the second episode in a sequence of two consecutive episodes. Perhaps a question for another day…</p>
<p>That’s about as much effort as I’m willing to put into this right now. As I said, not super deep, though I have a few ideas on how one can augment this data for some possible additional insights. Anyway, that’s it for now. Tune in for more fun stuff from me, and Live… from Ann Arbor… it’s Saturday Night! (spent staying in and procrastinating on actual work by writing this instead!)</p>
