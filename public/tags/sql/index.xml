Thought I would offer up a quick post on something that had sidetracked me earlier this week, namely how to extract notes and annotations in Mendeley using R. Basically I was having a similar problem as Daniel Hynk here, which he solved using Python. I too use Mendeley as a reference manager, which also has the handy feature of allowing users to add their own annotations and notes to their saved documents. While I have been generally satisfied with Mendeley, I was in a situation where I wanted to put together a table containing some information on a set of papers I had been reading, including, in particular, the notes I had been adding.</description>
